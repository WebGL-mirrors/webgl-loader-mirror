<title>UTF-8 Codepoint Decoding Tests</title>
</head>

<body>
This tests UTF-8 decoding. Namely, it checks that all valid codepoints
are properly decoded; even the ones that are illegal characters. The
first test is the important one; this library  should only generate
legal codepoints.<p>
For completeness, a second test that includes the surrogate pair
range [0xD800-0xDFFF] is also included. Interestingly, different
browsers appear to have different policies with respect to
substituting these illegal codepoints.
